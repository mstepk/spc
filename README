Simple Pie Charter - CLI to generate SVG pie charts

simpleBarCharter.sh, sbc, is Copyright 2007 and 2014 by Mark S. Kalusha, msk.

This program produces a simple pie chart in SVG format, given command line
inputs, values passed by the user.

The simplePieCharter (SPC) allows the user to pass a simple list of numbers on
the command line and get a pie chart of those numbers written to disk as an
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file that can be rendered esily by most modern
web browser. 

This program was previously named addSegmentValues.sh, which indicates that 
really it does little more then fill-in/add values to the SVG elements that
are includes under the spcTemplates sub-directory of this program.

The circleSegmentPathTemplate.svg is used to create a slices of the pie,
and segmentLabelTextTemplate.svg is used to label the slices.

The list of integers entered determines the number and size of each the
slices/segments of the pie chart being created.
  
Don't recall the last time I worked on this project, the modification date on
the file says 2012-12-08, but the notes in the file say last updated 2007-11-23.

I know its been several years, more than one or two for sure, since I've worked 
on it.  Likely the date on the file is the date I copied to the USB and now to
this machine.

I've got notes for versions 0.0 through 0.5 in the original work that I'm now
picking up on in February of 2014.  Now that I'm picking development back up,
I'll call those orginal 0.0 through 0.5 versions as 0.0.1 through 0.0.6.

So the check-in I'll make moving this into GitHub I'll call version 0.0.6.

Note that resuming work on this simplePieCharter utility is not a coincidence.
Over the last few weeks I wrote a simpleBarCharter utility which I have already
checked-in to GitHub.

The two programs SBC (Simple bat Charter) and SPC (Simple Pie Charter) are
companians and the future may be merged into a single program.

Other future plans are re-writing in some other then BASH, planning on Ruby,
developing a tactile control GUI, and distributing as an App for mobile and
tablet users.  These future plans will likely be done under a new project name.
